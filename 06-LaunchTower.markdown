# Launch Tower Setup

Overview:

With the exception of a impact wrench or angle drill, this should be a tool-less setup. If you think you need to use a tool, look for the labels on the tower.

## Materials
 - 3 Sand Screws
 - 3 Tower sections
 - 3 ratchet straps
 - Umbilica Bar
 - Antenna Bar
 - Launch Rail
 - Antenna bar adjustment bar
 - One small stake
 - Impact wrench or right angle drill.

## Setup

 1. Lay tower sections on the ground, aligining the 'rail up' labels so they are all going the same direction.

 1. Slide the antenna bar thru the 2 u-bolts at the top of the tower, such that the slot in the end of the antenna bar is on the side of the u-bolts that has 2 quick pins. Take 2 of the quick pins and place them thru the antenna bar such that it won't slide laterally. (there will be 1 quick pin dangling)
