- LV3 Box
- LV3 Small Hardware

## 1. Rocket Stand
- Verify that the stand is assembled and correctly tightened.
### 2. Assembling Rocket
- Verify that the protection rings are removed prior to assembly.
- Torque Settings: 40 in/oz
- First 3 screws as equilateral triangle (every other hole, the order doesn't matter.)
- *Note: on some modules screw length matters.*
- Put in the spider before attaching the motor.
- Spider can be a little finicky. Wiggle it.
- Make sure the washers go back to their spots.
#### 3. Sequence 1
- **Tape on the key to the motor casing**
- Take the protective rings off the motor module and the fin can.
- Remove the bottom protective ring from the fin can.
- If the key is taped on, remove the key first before the shake test.**
- Insert the motor in the motor casing.
- Thrust flange, flatside towards space.
- **Figure out the correct wench size for 3/8 nut.**
- Put the fin can on the motor casing.
- **14mm wench is close enough.**
- Before screwing the motor onto the fin can, put the motor module (with the spider attached) onto the motor mount.
- *When the bolt is threaded through the top of the spiper, someone needs to hold the key ring tool.*
- **Screws should be in to make sure everything is aligned before tightening everything down.**
- Fasten the modules together.
- **When putting in the screws, make sure they are locktight!**
- Use the bar to hold the key ring stationary as the bolt is attached through the spider. Tighten it until the motor doesn't jiggle.
- 1/4 in screws for the thrust flange
- Check the tightness of the top bolt again.
- Check for any shakyness
- Put onto stand (See diagram)
- **DIAGRAM**
...
Flight Computer
- **Need technical diagram for the computer module.**
- Remove the protective rings
- Remove the protective rings from the umbilical ring.
- Electrical connectors are color coded.
- When two modules are put together, they need to be screwed together or they will not stay together.
- When putting the umbilical onto the flight computer, the flight computer cables go through the marked (red) hole. 
- 1 cable attaches, 3 pass through.
- Next, remove the protective rings for the camera ring.
- Wires go through the marked hole.
- Do not remove the tape from the cameras.
- Remove the bottom protective ring from the flight computer (blue).
- Prior to attaching the flight computer to the motor module, attach Airframe temp sensor.
- When attaching the flight computer to the base (motor module), the "back" aligns to the rail sled.
- Use the coupling example diagram for knowing the screw sizes.
...
- Remove the top from the RCS module.
- Remove the protective rings from ENSR.
- Push it until it is tight, then pull back a quarter turn
- ENSR, rear to rail sled
- Next attach the nose code to the top of the ENSR.
- The ENSR sub assembly will already have the nose cone attached.
- **Need to re-make one of the top layers of the rail sleds.**
