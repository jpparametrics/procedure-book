# Meta
## build system
- [ ] Make a recipe/script to build the cover page, rather than making it manually in Inkscape every time.
      It would be really sweet if it were in native LaTeX.
- [ ] Look into using the `booklet` package instead of `pdfpages`.
- [ ] make a way for people to configure a custom selection of chapters for their booklet
- [ ] make recipies for team-specific booklets (related to above)
- [X] organizing the chapters so they don't spam up the top level dir

## general
- [ ] Create a nomenclature section (acronyms you'd need to know on a launch weekend)
- [ ] create TODOs for each existing chapter
    - [ ] identify procedures that are no longer relevant to LV3
